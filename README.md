# Project-FINAL-Peace-Formers-Game
# My project is about a cat and a mouse. The cat moves and has to eat the rat that are represented as the grey circles and the cat is the yellow big circle. With the North, West, East, and south Button on the left side you can move to get the mices. When you get a mice occurs is that hen you get the correct mice you get point and if you get the incorrect one you get stuck in the trap an loose points. This is a  peace form because thr cat eats the mice and we don't have t be worried about the house being filled with rats and the rat eating our thing coth, food, etc.
